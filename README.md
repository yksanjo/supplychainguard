# SupplyChainGuard

> AI Development Tool Security Platform

## What This Is

SupplyChainGuard is an open-source security platform that protects your software development process from risks introduced by AI coding tools (like GitHub Copilot, Amazon CodeWhisperer, ChatGPT Code Interpreter). It monitors AI tool behavior, validates dependencies, and generates software bills of materials (SBOMs).

## The Current Landscape

Developers are using AI coding tools everywhere - they're incredibly helpful for writing code faster. But here's the thing: these tools can suggest code with vulnerabilities, or they can suggest dependencies that have known security issues, or they can be compromised themselves.

The software supply chain is already a major attack vector (remember SolarWinds?). Now we're adding AI tools to the mix, which creates new risks:
- AI tools might suggest malicious code
- AI-suggested dependencies might be compromised
- AI tools themselves might be compromised
- Code generated by AI might have hidden backdoors

Traditional supply chain security tools don't understand AI-generated code. They look for known vulnerabilities in packages, but they don't analyze the code generation process itself. We need tools that understand both.

## Why We Built This

We built SupplyChainGuard because we saw developers adopting AI coding tools faster than security teams could assess the risks. Rather than banning these tools (which isn't realistic), we wanted to make it safer to use them.

By open-sourcing this:
- **Developers can use AI tools confidently** - Knowing their code is being validated
- **Security teams get visibility** - They can see what AI tools are being used and what risks they introduce
- **The community can improve detection** - More use cases means better vulnerability detection
- **Transparency builds trust** - Supply chain security should be open and auditable

This is about making AI-assisted development safer, not stopping it.

## What SupplyChainGuard Does

SupplyChainGuard monitors your entire development process when AI tools are involved:
- **AI tool behavior monitoring** - Tracks what code AI tools suggest and when
- **Package verification** - Validates that AI-suggested dependencies are legitimate
- **Dependency scanning** - Checks for vulnerabilities in AI-suggested packages
- **SBOM generation** - Creates software bills of materials for compliance
- **Build reproducibility** - Validates that builds are deterministic
- **Threat intelligence** - Monitors for supply chain attacks

It integrates with your CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, etc.) and can block merges if it finds critical issues. It also provides isolated sandbox environments for safe AI tool testing.

## Who This Is For

This is for:
- **Developers** using AI coding tools who want to write secure code
- **Security teams** managing software supply chain risks
- **DevOps teams** setting up secure development pipelines
- **Organizations** adopting AI coding tools at scale

## Current Status

This is an open-source project in active development. We're building this in public because we believe supply chain security should be accessible to everyone.
