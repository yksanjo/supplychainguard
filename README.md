# SupplyChainGuard

> AI Development Tool Security Platform

## What This Is

SupplyChainGuard is an open-source security platform that protects your software development process from risks introduced by AI coding tools (like GitHub Copilot, Amazon CodeWhisperer, ChatGPT Code Interpreter). It monitors AI tool behavior, validates dependencies, and generates software bills of materials (SBOMs).

## The Current Landscape

Developers are using AI coding tools everywhere - they're incredibly helpful for writing code faster. But here's the thing: these tools can suggest code with vulnerabilities, or they can suggest dependencies that have known security issues, or they can be compromised themselves.

The software supply chain is already a major attack vector (remember SolarWinds?). Now we're adding AI tools to the mix, which creates new risks:
- AI tools might suggest malicious code
- AI-suggested dependencies might be compromised
- AI tools themselves might be compromised
- Code generated by AI might have hidden backdoors

Traditional supply chain security tools don't understand AI-generated code. They look for known vulnerabilities in packages, but they don't analyze the code generation process itself. We need tools that understand both.

## Why We Built This

We built SupplyChainGuard because we saw developers adopting AI coding tools faster than security teams could assess the risks. Rather than banning these tools (which isn't realistic), we wanted to make it safer to use them.

By open-sourcing this:
- **Developers can use AI tools confidently** - Knowing their code is being validated
- **Security teams get visibility** - They can see what AI tools are being used and what risks they introduce
- **The community can improve detection** - More use cases means better vulnerability detection
- **Transparency builds trust** - Supply chain security should be open and auditable

This is about making AI-assisted development safer, not stopping it.

## What SupplyChainGuard Does

SupplyChainGuard monitors your entire development process when AI tools are involved:
- **AI tool behavior monitoring** - Tracks what code AI tools suggest and when
- **Package verification** - Validates that AI-suggested dependencies are legitimate
- **Dependency scanning** - Checks for vulnerabilities in AI-suggested packages
- **SBOM generation** - Creates software bills of materials for compliance
- **Build reproducibility** - Validates that builds are deterministic
- **Threat intelligence** - Monitors for supply chain attacks

It integrates with your CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, etc.) and can block merges if it finds critical issues. It also provides isolated sandbox environments for safe AI tool testing.

## How We're Different

### vs. Software Composition Analysis (Snyk, WhiteSource, Checkmarx)

**What They Do**: Dependency vulnerability scanning, license compliance, general supply chain security.

**What We Do**: AI coding tool security, AI-generated code analysis, AI tool behavior monitoring.

**Our Advantage**:
- **AI Tool Focus**: We monitor AI coding tools themselves, not just dependencies
- **AI Code Analysis**: Understands AI-generated code patterns (they scan human code)
- **Behavioral Monitoring**: Tracks AI tool usage and behavior (they don't)
- **SBOM for AI Code**: Generates SBOMs including AI-generated components
- **Isolated Testing**: Sandbox environments for AI tools (they don't offer this)

**The Reality**: Snyk is great for dependency scanning. But when GitHub Copilot suggests code with a backdoor, Snyk sees "normal Python code." We see "AI-generated code with supply chain risk."

**Positioning**:
> "Snyk scans dependencies. We scan AI coding tools AND dependencies. Different problems, different tools."

### vs. Vendor Risk Platforms (RiskRecon, BitSight, SecurityScorecard)

**What They Do**: Vendor security ratings, continuous monitoring, third-party risk.

**What We Do**: Software supply chain security, AI tool risk assessment, SBOM management.

**Our Advantage**:
- **Software Focus**: SBOM generation, dependency scanning (they focus on vendor ratings)
- **AI Tool Assessment**: Evaluates AI coding tools as vendors (they don't)
- **Code-Level Analysis**: Analyzes actual code, not just vendor questionnaires
- **Development Integration**: Works in CI/CD, not just periodic assessments

**The Reality**: BitSight is great for vendor risk. But when you need to assess GitHub Copilot as a vendor and scan its code suggestions, you need specialized tools.

### vs. Build-It-Yourself

**What They Do**: Internal teams building custom supply chain security.

**What We Do**: Open-source, pre-built AI tool monitoring, community-maintained.

**Our Advantage**:
- **Save 12-18 Months**: Don't rebuild supply chain security from scratch
- **AI Tool Expertise**: Understands AI coding tools specifically
- **Always Updated**: New AI tools? We add monitoring. New attacks? We add detection.
- **Cost**: Free vs. $400K+ internal development

**The Reality**: Supply chain security is hard. AI tool monitoring, SBOM generation, vulnerability correlation - we've already solved it.

## Who This Is For

This is for:
- **Developers** using AI coding tools who want to write secure code
- **Security teams** managing software supply chain risks
- **DevOps teams** setting up secure development pipelines
- **Organizations** adopting AI coding tools at scale
- **Banks building software** (digital transformation)
- **Mid-market companies** who can't afford $200K+ enterprise tools

## Target Segments

### Banks Building Software (Digital Transformation)
**Why We Fit**: Need SBOM generation, dependency scanning, AI tool assessment.

**Positioning**: "BitSight tells you a vendor has problems. We tell you exactly which dependencies are vulnerable and how to fix them."

### Organizations Using AI Coding Tools
**Why We Fit**: New risk category - AI tools as vendors, need specialized assessment.

**Positioning**: "Snyk scans dependencies. We scan AI coding tools AND dependencies. Different problems, different tools."

### Mid-Market Companies
**Why We Fit**: Can't afford $200K+ enterprise tools, but need supply chain security.

**Positioning**: "Enterprise-grade supply chain security at mid-market prices."

## Our Competitive Advantages

1. **AI Tool Focus**: We monitor AI coding tools themselves, not just dependencies
2. **AI Code Analysis**: Understands AI-generated code patterns (they scan human code)
3. **Behavioral Monitoring**: Tracks AI tool usage and behavior (they don't)
