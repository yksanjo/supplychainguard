# Executive Brief: Agentic AI Security Suite
## For C-Suite and Board Members of Financial Institutions

**2-Page Summary | January 2025**

## What Is "Agentic AI" and Why Should We Care?

### In Simple Terms

**Agentic AI** = AI systems that act autonomously, making decisions and taking actions without human approval for each step.

**Examples in Banking:**
- AI chatbot that processes customer payment requests automatically
- AI system that routes payments through SWIFT networks
- AI tool that writes code for your banking software
- AI agent that manages treasury operations

### The 2026 Risk

**Industry Timeline:**
- **2024**: Banks are piloting AI agents
- **2025**: Rapid adoption expected
- **2026**: Widespread deployment + **NEW RISKS** emerge

**Why 2026 Matters:**
- Regulatory bodies (OCC, FCA, ECB) are flagging risks NOW
- Industry reports predict rapid adoption in 2025-2026
- Combination of faster adoption + novel risks = **Credible disruption scenario**
