# Assessment: Will Bankers Understand and Find This Useful?

## Current State Analysis

### ✅ **STRENGTHS - What Works Well**

1. **Direct Relevance**
   - ✅ Addresses specific banks by name (JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, etc.)
   - ✅ Uses real examples (JPMorgan's $6T daily payments, Bank of America's Erica)
   - ✅ Addresses actual pain points (legacy cores, regulatory exams)

2. **Financial Language**
   - ✅ Uses banking terminology (G-SIBs, payment rails, SWIFT, ACH)
   - ✅ Includes ROI with dollar figures ($5.6M incidents, $10M fines)
   - ✅ References regulatory bodies (OCC, FCA, ECB, Fed)

3. **Business Value**
   - ✅ Clear ROI calculations
   - ✅ Risk reduction metrics
   - ✅ Operational efficiency gains

### ⚠️ **POTENTIAL ISSUES - What May Confuse Bankers**

1. **Technical Jargon**
   - ❌ "Agentic AI" - not commonly understood
   - ❌ "Prompt injection" - technical term
   - ❌ "CI/CD pipelines" - developer terminology
   - ❌ "Model drift" - ML-specific term

2. **Document Length**
   - ❌ Very long documents (800+ lines per product)
   - ❌ Executives may not read all details
   - ❌ Missing quick executive summary

3. **Assumed Knowledge**
   - ❌ Assumes understanding of AI agent risks
   - ❌ May not explain "why 2026" clearly enough
   - ❌ Technical architecture details may overwhelm

4. **Missing Elements**
   - ❌ No visual diagrams or infographics
   - ❌ No case studies from real banks
   - ❌ No comparison to existing solutions
   - ❌ Limited "what happens if we don't act" scenarios

## Recommendations to Improve Understanding

### 1. **Create Executive Summary Document**

**Problem**: Current docs are too long for busy executives.

**Solution**: Create a 2-page executive summary that:
- Explains "agentic AI" in simple terms
- Shows the 2026 risk timeline
- Lists 3-5 key risks with dollar impact
- Provides quick ROI summary
- Includes "next steps" call to action

### 2. **Add Plain Language Explanations**

**Problem**: Technical terms may confuse non-technical bankers.

**Solution**: Add a glossary or "in simple terms" sections:
- "Agentic AI" = AI systems that act autonomously without human approval
- "Prompt injection" = Hackers tricking AI chatbots to do unauthorized actions
- "Model drift" = AI making worse decisions over time

### 3. **Create Visual Summaries**

**Problem**: Text-heavy documents are hard to scan.

**Solution**: Add:
- Risk timeline diagram (2025 → 2026)
- Product architecture diagram
- ROI comparison chart
- Risk vs. solution matrix

### 4. **Add Real-World Scenarios**

**Problem**: Abstract risks don't feel urgent.

**Solution**: Include "What Could Go Wrong" scenarios:
- "Scenario: AI agent at Bank X processes 10,000 fraudulent payments in 5 minutes"
- "Scenario: Legacy core corruption takes 3 weeks to recover, $8M cost"
- "Scenario: Regulatory exam finds AI governance gaps, $10M fine"

### 5. **Simplify Individual Product Repos**

**Problem**: Each repo's README is still technical.

**Solution**: Make README more executive-friendly:
- Start with "What problem does this solve?"
- Use simple language
- Focus on business outcomes, not technical features
- Include "Who needs this?" section
